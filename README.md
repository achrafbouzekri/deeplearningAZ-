This repo contains personal projects implementing different Deep Learning algorithms with `tensorflow`, `keras`, and `PyTorch`.

## ANN

The first project contains an Artificial Neural Network.

This is a simple neural network predicting the churn probability of existing customers. 

After processing the data and building the ANN, the model predicts churn in the 6 months with an accuracy of 84%.
